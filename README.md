### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: Intro to Philosophy 101 - Comparing the different schools of philosophical thought
+ This project is conducted by Kejun Liu

+ Project summary: Philosophy is defined to be the "systematic study of general questions". It usually consists of broad and abstract topics where there can be many different perspectives and approaches. A group of people who share common characteristics of opinion form a specific school of thought. There are, in fact, many different schools of philosophical thought that focus on different ideas and topics. In this data notebook, I aim at gaining a deeper insight on the different schools of philosophical thought  by analyzing the different charateristics and topics.
